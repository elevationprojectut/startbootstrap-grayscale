          <p class="text-white-50">My name is Nate Fox, my wife Jackie and I met at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. We along with our 5 kids have been living in Utah for 17 years. We refer to our crew as "The Fox Den". Towards the end of 2002, we sensed God leading us to leave our family and friends and move to Utah with a job transfer. From 2002-2010 I worked various jobs in the business world. When we moved here we didn't know anyone and didn’t know of a Christian church in the area. We live in a very unique place in American. Our county of 600,000+ belongs almost exclusively to the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS). 83% of the population in fact.  This can be a challenge for many people, even our LDS friends find the monolithic culture demanding on them. We decided early on that we would embrace the challenge to understand our culture, earn trust with our friends, and enjoy having great spiritual conversations. By God’s grace we have lived here well and we have enjoyed joining Jesus on His Great Commission. We love Utah, we love the people of Utah, and we know God has us here for a reason. From 2010-2018 I was a Pastor at an Evangelical Free Church in Utah Valley. During my time there we privileged to see many people come and discover Jesus in a whole new way and receive the grace of God found in the gospel. During this time we have learned so much about how to effectively minister in this unique culture.</p>

          <h2 class="text-white mb-4">The Need</h2>
          <p class="text-white-50">The presence of evangelical Christian churches in Utah is rather small. For example our town, Saratoga Springs, of 30,000 people has only 2 Evangelical churches. In our valley of over half a million there is only two churches who have Pastors that are not on missionary support. One major Christian denomination that is planting churches in Utah has a staggering 90% failure rate. You may ask why are churches unable to succeed? It’s not because it’s impossible for churches to grow here, it’s because the unique culture of Utah requires a well understood missiology. You wouldn’t plant a church in the middle of India without taking tremendous time to study the religious groups, the people, and the culture. Missions organizations spend a great deal of time and energy seeking to understand. But that’s precisely the problem in Utah. The vast majority of Evangelicals don’t see this as a cross-cultural mission field, because it’s nestled in the Rocky Mountains in the Western United States. However this is a massive mistake because this culture is as unique and hard to understand as anything worldwide!

              My heart is to see the existing church-plants and pastors encouraged. My hope is to help them process how their church can become more culturally effective and hone in our their unique part in fulfilling the Great Commission. Having a clear missiology means we are able to speak their language and contextualize the gospel so they hear it with greater clarity. It takes time and patience to develop and equip our churches.
              
              Most church planters come to Utah with a tremendous sense of calling and zeal, but it’s easy to become discouraged when ministry gets hard. Utah Pastor’s face tremendous discouragement! While the mission and vision here is clear and compelling, the leadership resources and the financial resources are paper thin. For these reasons the majority of church-plants in Utah fail within the first 3 years. We want to see that change! The need for encouragement for pastors, churches, and believers in Utah is greater than you can imagine. The church in Utah has many needs, but we believe a ministry that can come alongside pastors to encourage them, support them, and work with them to fulfill the Great Commission in culturally effective ways, is of the highest importance right now!

                  <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">The word elevation has two implications: 
                      1. We are working with churches in the high elevation states of the Mountain West.
                      2. We are compelled by Jesus’ challenge in John 4:35 to “Look up! and see that the fields are already white for harvest!” Many scholars believe that Jesus was telling his disciples to look up at Mount Gerizim in Samaria where they could see worshippers walking down from their temple dressed in all white. I believe that Utah is our Samaria. We are ministering to a people from a differing religious perspective that rivals are own. I believe that Jesus would have us love LDS people the way He loved Samaritans.
                      
                      Mission: The Elevation project exists to come alongside churches in Utah to help them fulfill the Great Commission in culturally effective ways :
                      
                      Vision: 
                      Encourage Pastors who are often doing the work of ministry without much help.
                      Assist them in fulfilling the Great Commission with a clear missiology.
                      Create cultural equipping for believers to understand the culture and live in it well.
                      Assimilate seekers into churches and help them gain a Christian Worldview.
                      Create opportunities for churches outside of Utah to join the mission in Utah.
